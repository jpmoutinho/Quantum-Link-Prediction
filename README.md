# Quantum Link Prediction in Complex Networks
### Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04768

This repository includes the code for the QLP method proposed in the paper above, as well as example input and output files. The input is an edge-list for a complex network which can have the nodes numbered from 0 to N-1 or from 1 to N, and the output are two edge-lists corresponding to predictions based in the even or odd components of the method ordered from best to worst according to the respective scores, as described in the paper. Note: the output edge lists have the nodes numbered from 1 to N.
