This repository includes the code for the QLP method proposed in the paper above, as well as example input and output files. 

- Input: edge-list for a complex network which can have the nodes numbered from 0 to N-1 or from 1 to N
- Output: two edge-lists corresponding to predictions based in the even or odd components of the method ordered from best to worst according to the respective scores, as described in the paper. 

Note: the output edge lists have the nodes numbered from 1 to N.
